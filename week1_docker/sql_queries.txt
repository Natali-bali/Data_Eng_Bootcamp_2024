1.  Count records
How many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?
Tip: started and finished on 2019-09-18.

SELECT COUNT(1) FROM green_taxi_data
WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime >= timestamp '2019-09-18 00:00:00'
  and lpep_dropoff_datetime < timestamp '2019-09-19 00:00:00';   ==15612

2. Largest trip for each day
Which was the pick up day with the largest trip distance 
Use the pick up time for your calculations.

SELECT foo.PU_DAY, foo.TRIP_DIST
FROM (SELECT date_trunc('day', lpep_pickup_datetime) AS PU_DAY,
			MAX(trip_distance) AS TRIP_DIST
		FROM green_taxi_data
	    GROUP BY PU_DAY ) AS foo
ORDER BY foo.TRIP_DIST DESC
LIMIT 1; =="2019-09-26 00:00:00"

3. Three biggest pick up Boroughs
Consider lpep_pickup_datetime in '2019-09-18' and ignoring Borough has Unknown
Which were the 3 pick up Boroughs that had a sum of total_amount superior to 50000?
SELECT foo.borough, foo.total_amount FROM
( SELECT date_trunc('day', lpep_pickup_datetime) AS PU_DAY,
       zones."Borough" AS BOROUGH,
	   SUM(fare_amount) AS TOTAL_AMOUNT
	   FROM green_taxi_data AS taxi
	   INNER JOIN zones AS zones
	   ON zones."LocationID" = taxi."PULocationID"
	   GROUP BY PU_DAY, BOROUGH 
	   ) AS foo
WHERE foo.PU_DAY = timestamp '2019-09-18 00:00:00'
AND foo.total_amount > 50000;  =="Brooklyn" "Manhattan" "Queens"

4. Largest tip
For the passengers picked up in September 2019 in the zone name Astoria 
which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip? 
We want the name of the zone, not the id.
Note: it's not a typo, it's tip , not trip
SELECT date_trunc('day', lpep_pickup_datetime) AS PU_DAY,
       pu_zone."Zone",
	   do_zone."Zone" AS d_zone,
	   tip_amount AS tip
	   FROM green_taxi_data AS taxi
	   INNER JOIN zones AS pu_zone
	   ON pu_zone."LocationID" = taxi."PULocationID"
	   INNER JOIN zones AS do_zone
	   ON do_zone."LocationID" = taxi."DOLocationID" 
	   WHERE pu_zone."Zone" = 'Astoria' 
	   AND taxi."lpep_pickup_datetime" < timestamp '2019-10-01 00:00:00'
	   AND taxi."lpep_pickup_datetime" >= timestamp '2019-09-01 00:00:00'
	   ORDER BY taxi."tip_amount" desc
	   LIMIT 1;  == "2019-09-08 00:00:00"	"Astoria"	"JFK Airport"	62.31
